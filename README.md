This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

### Build APK

## First Disable Metro Bundler

By default, React Native apps built in debug mode expect the Metro Bundler to be running. To avoid this requirement (because we want the APK to run independently), you need to make a small change:

Open the MainApplication.java file in your Android project, located at: 
android/app/src/main/java/com/yourprojectname/MainApplication.java

Inside MainApplication.java, look for the following line:

```java
public boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() {
    return BuildConfig.DEBUG;
}
```

Replace it with:

```java
public boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() {
    return false;  // Disable developer support to avoid requiring Metro bundler
}
```

## Step 1: Clean the project (optional but recommended): 
```bash
./gradlew clean
```

## Step 2: Bundle the latest JavaScript
```bash
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res/
```

## Step 3: build the APK
```bash
# debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug
# OR for release:
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

## Step 4: Install the APK on your device
```bash
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```
